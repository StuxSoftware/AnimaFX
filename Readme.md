Since you should be independent.

Normal Karaoke-Software require you to use a specific
programming language with a roughly incompatible
library to bind you to their software.

My aim with this software is to allow anyone to use
or create their effects without being required to use
Windows (to have a working software for generating
karaoke effects.)

Large quantities of the software can be reused in
other software.
